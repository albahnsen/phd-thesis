The performance of this proposal is checked throughout a simulation study considering a variety of circular distributions exhibiting multimodality, peakedness and/or skewness. The plug-in rule behavior is also compared with other existing bandwidth selectors. The method is illustrated with some classical datasets. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhou2010,
abstract = {A popular approach to cost-sensitive learning is to rescale the classes according to their misclassification costs. Although this approach is effective in dealing with binary-class problems, recent studies show that it is often not so helpful when being applied to multi- class problems directly. This paper analyzes that why the traditional rescaling approach is often helpless on multi-class problems, which reveals that before apply- ing rescaling, the consistency of the costs must be ex- amined. Based on the analysis, a new approach is pre- sented, which should be the choice if the user wants to use rescaling for multi-class cost-sensitive learn- ing. Moreover, this paper shows that the proposed ap- proach is helpful when unequal misclassification costs and class imbalance occur simultaneously, and can also be used to tackle pure class-imbalance learning. Thus, the proposed approach provides a unified framework for using rescaling to address multi-class cost-sensitive learning aswell asmulti-class class-imbalance learning.

They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

@inproceedings{Li2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we study cost-sensitive semi-supervised learning where many of the training examples are unlabeled and different misclassification errors are associated with unequal costs. This scenario occurs in many real-world applications. For example, in some disease diagnosis, the cost of erroneously diagnosing a patient as healthy is much higher than that of diagnosing a healthy person as a patient. Also, the acquisition of labeled data requires medical diagnosis which is expensive, while the collection of unlabeled data such as basic health information is much cheaper. We propose the CS4VM (Cost-Sensitive Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine) to address this problem. We show that the CS4VM, when given the label means of the unlabeled data, closely approximates the supervised cost-sensitive SVM that has access to the ground-truth labels of all the unlabeled data. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm which first estimates the label means and then trains the CS4VM with the plug-in label means by an efficient SVM solver. Experiments on a broad range of data sets show that the proposed method is capable of reducing the total cost and is computationally efficient.},

If your organization needs to adapt to harsh new realities, but you don't yet have a strategy that will get you out in front of your competitors, you need Business Model Generation.Co-created by 470 "Business Model Canvas" practitioners from 45 countries, the book features a beautiful, highly visual, 4-color design that takes powerful strategic ideas and tools, and makes them easy to implement in your organization. It explains the most common Business Model patterns, based on concepts from leading business thinkers, and helps you reinterpret them for your own context. You will learn how to systematically understand, design, and implement a game-changing business model--or analyze and renovate an old one. Along the way, you'll understand at a much deeper level your customers, distribution channels, partners, revenue streams, costs, and your core value proposition.Business Model Generation features practical innovation techniques used today by leading consultants and companies worldwide, including 3M, Ericsson, Capgemini, Deloitte, and others. Designed for doers, it is for those ready to abandon outmoded thinking and embrace new models of value creation: for executives, consultants, entrepreneurs, and leaders of all organizations. If you're ready to change the rules, you belong to "the business model generation!"},

abstract = {Deep learning research aims at discovering learning algorithms that discover multiple levels of distributed representations, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. Although the study of deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges.},

The uni ed decomposition sheds light on a number of sig- ni cant issues: the relation between some of the previously-proposed decompositions for zero-one loss and the original one for squared loss, the relation between bias, variance and Schapire et al.'s (1997) notion of margin, and the nature of the trade-o between bias and variance in classi cation. While the bias- variance behavior of zero-one loss and vari- able misclassi cation costs is quite di erent from that of squared loss, this di erence de- rives directly from the di erent de nitions of loss. We have applied the proposed decom- position to decision tree learning, instance- based learning and boosting on a large suite of benchmark data sets, and made several sig- ni cant observations.},

abstract = {This paper presents the tuning of the structure and parameters of a neural network using an improved genetic algorithm (GA). It is also shown that the improved GA performs better than the standard GA based on some benchmark test functions. A neural network with switches introduced to its links is proposed. By doing this, the proposed neural network can learn both the input-output relationships of an application and the network structure using the improved GA. The number of hidden nodes is chosen manually by increasing it from a small number until the learning performance in terms of fitness value is good enough. Application examples on sunspot forecasting and associative memory are given to show the merits of the improved GA and the proposed neural network.},

@book{Thomas2009a,
abstract = {A text aimed at credit analysts in industry and students in Statistics, Management Science, Operational Research and Banking and Finance Masters courses that will use simple probability models and logical arguments to explain consumer credit scoring. - ;The use of credit scoring - the quantitative and statistical techniques to assess the credit risks involved in lending to consumers - has been one of the most successful if unsung applications of mathematics in business for the last fifty years. Now with lenders changing their objectives from minimising defaults to maximising profits, the saturation of the consumer credit market allowing borrowers to be more discriminating in their choice of which loans, mortgages and credit cards to use, and the Basel Accord banking regulations raising the profile of credit scoring within banks there are a number of challenges that require new models that use credit scores as inputs and extensions of the ideas in credit scoring. This book reviews the current methodology and measures used in credit scoring and then looks at the models that can be used to address these new challenges. The first chapter describes what a credit score is and how a scorecard is built which gives credit scores and models how the score is used in the lending decision. The second chapter describes the different ways the quality of a scorecard can be measured and points out how some of these measure the discrimination of the score, some the probability prediction of the score, and some the categorical predictions that are made using the score. The remaining three chapters address how to use risk and response scoring to model the new problems in consumer lending. Chapter three looks at models that assist in deciding how to vary the loan terms made to different potential borrowers depending on their individual characteristics. Risk based pricing is the most common approach being introduced. Chapter four describes how one can use Markov chains and survival analysis to model the dynamics of a borrower's repayment and ordering behaviour . These models allow one to make decisions that maximise the profitability of the borrower to the lender and can be considered as part of a customer relationship management strategy. The last chapter looks at how the new banking regulations in the Basel Accord apply to consumer lending. It develops models that show how they will change the operating decisions used in consumer lending and how their need for stress testing requires the development of new models to assess the credit risk of portfolios of consumer loans rather than a models of the credit risks of individual loans. -},

abstract = {Credit card fraud falls broadly into two categories: behavioural fraud and application fraud. Application fraud occurs when individuals obtain new credit cards from issuing companies using false personal information and then spend as much as possible in a short space of time. However, most credit card fraud is behavioural and occurs when details of legitimate cards have been obtained fraudulently and sales are made on a 'Cardholder Not Present' basis. These sales include telephone sales and e-commerce transactions where only the card details are required. In this paper, we are concerned with detecting behavioural fraud through the analysis of longitudinal data. These data usually consist of credit card transactions over time, but can include other variables, both static and longitudinal. Statistical methods for fraud detection are often classification (supervised) methods that discriminate between known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions; however, these methods rely on accurate identification of fraudulent transactions in historical databases -- information that is often in short supply or non-existent. We are particularly interested in unsupervised methods that do not use this information but instead detect changes in behaviour or unusual transactions. We discuss two methods for unsupervised fraud detection in credit data in this paper and apply them to some real data sets. Peer group analysis is a new tool for monitoring behaviour over time in data mining situations. In particular, the tool detects individual accounts that begin to behave in a way distinct from accounts to which they had previously been similar. Each account is selected as a target account and is compared with all other accounts in the database, using either external comparison criteria or i...},

abstract = {Abstract While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams. Keywords: comparative studies, statistical methods, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Friedman test, multiple comparisons tests},

abstract = {The interest for data mining techniques has increased tremendously during the past decades, and numerous classification techniques have been applied in a wide range of business applications. Hence, the need for adequate performance measures has become more important than ever. In this paper, a cost benefit analysis framework is formalized in order to define performance measures which are aligned with the main objectives of the end users, i.e. profit maximization. A new performance measure is defined, the expected maximum profit criterion. This general framework is then applied to the customer churn problem with its particular cost benefit structure. The advantage of this approach is that it assists companies with selecting the classifier which maximizes the profit. Moreover, it aids with the practical implementation in the sense that it provides guidance about the fraction of the customer base to be included in the retention campaign.},

abstract = {Gradient boosting constructs additive regression models by sequentially fitting a simple parameterized function (base learner) to current "pseudo" -residuals by least squares at each iteration. The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

An in-depth look at innovative approaches to credit risk management written by industry practitioners. This publication will serve as an essential reference text for those who wish to make credit accessible to underserved consumers. It is comprehensive and clearly written."--The Honorable Rodney E. Hood"Abrahams and Zhang's timely treatise is a must-read for all those interested in the critical role of credit in the economy. They ably explore the intersection of credit access and credit risk, suggesting a hybrid approach of human judgment and computer models as the necessary path to balanced and fair lending. In an environment of rapidly changing consumer demographics, as well as regulatory reform initiatives, this book suggests new analytical models by which to provide credit to ensure compliance and to manage enterprise risk."--Frank A. Hirsch Jr., Nelson Mullins Riley \& Scarborough LLP Financial Services Attorney and former general counsel for Centura Banks, Inc."This book tackles head on the market failures that our current risk management systems need to address. Not only do Abrahams and Zhang adeptly articulate why we can and should improve our systems, they provide the analytic evidence, and the steps toward implementations. Fair Lending Compliance fills a much-needed gap in the field. If implemented systematically, this thought leadership will lead to improvements in fair lending practices for all Americans." --Alyssa Stewart Lee, Deputy Director, Urban Markets Initiative The Brookings Institution"[Fair Lending Compliance]...provides a unique blend of qualitative and quantitative guidance to two kinds of financial institutions: those that just need a little help in staying on the right side of complex fair housing regulations; and those that aspire to industry leadership in profitably and responsibly serving the unmet credit needs of diverse businesses and consumers in America's emerging domestic markets."--Michael A.

@misc{Hand2007,
abstract = {The talk begins by setting the context: fraud is defined and its breadth outlined; figures are given showing how significant fraud is; and different areas of fraud are examined, including health care fraud, banking fraud, and scientific fraud. The particular data analytic challenges of banking fraud are described and illustrated in detail. These include the fact that the classes are highly unbalanced (with typically no more than 1 in a 1000 transactions being fraudulent), that class labels may often be incorrect, that there will typically be delays in discovering the true labels, that the transaction arrival times are random, that the data are dynamic, and, perhaps most challenging of all, that the distributions are reactive, changing in response to the implementation of fraud detection systems. The role of mechanistic and empirical models in tackling these problems is described. Both have been widely used, and both have a contribution to make. Banking data, and in particular banking fraud data are examined in detail. Raw credit card transaction data have 70-80 variables per transaction, and this can be multiplied many-fold for behavioural data, as in fraud detection problems. Questions arise as to how to aggregate the data: should one try to classify individual transactions or should activity records be constructed? A fundamental aspect of any predictive problem in data analysis is the choice of an appropriate criterion for estimation and performance assessment. In the case of fraud, one needs, in particular, to combine both classification accuracy and timeliness of classification. This means that standard measures of classification performance, such as error rate, AUC, KS statistic, information value, etc, are not sufficient. Suitable measures and performance curves are described which combine these aspects and which are now being adopted by the industry. Various statistical (used here in John Chambers’s sense of ‘greater statistics’) approaches have been developed for fraud detection problems, and some are described and illustrated, using data from some of the banks which have been collaborating with us. In particular, we look at supervised classification and anomaly detection methods. Finally in the context of banking fraud, some of the deeper but very important conceptual issues are outlined, including the economic imperative, whether fraud is now becoming ‘acceptable’, and what exactly we learn from empirical comparisons, Scientific fraud is contrasted with banking fraud. They have rather different drivers. In particular, financial gain is generally irrelevant to scientific fraud, which makes it an unusual kind of fraud - although, of course, the impact can be even more serious. Several examples are given, from a range of disciplines. The role of data analytic tools in detecting scientific fraud, and the nature of such tools, is described},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the generalization properties of online learning based stochastic methods for supervised learning problems where the loss function is dependent on more than one training sample (e.g., metric learning, ranking). We present a generic decoupling technique that enables us to provide Rademacher complexity-based generalization error bounds. Our bounds are in general tighter than those obtained by Wang et al (COLT 2012) for the same problem. Using our decoupling technique, we are further able to obtain fast convergence rates for strongly convex pairwise loss functions. We are also able to analyze a class of memory efficient online learning algorithms for pairwise learning problems that use only a bounded subset of past training samples to update the hypothesis at each step. Finally, in order to complement our generalization bounds, we propose a novel memory efficient online learning algorithm for higher order learning problems with bounded regret guarantees.},

abstract = {The problem of improving the accuracy of a hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free learning model is considered. A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples from the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output a hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce a hypothesis that forms only slightly better than random guessing. It is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent. An explicit method is described for directly converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences},

The bias-variance decomposition for quadratic loss functions is well known and serves as an important tool for analyzing learning algorithms, yet no decomposition was offered for the more commonly used zero-one (misclassification) loss functions until the recent work of Kong \& Dietterich (1995) and and Breiman (1996). Their decomposition suffers from some major shortcomings though (e.g., potentially negative variance), which our decomposition avoids. We show that, in practice, the naive frequency-based estimation of the decomposition terms is by itself biased and show how to correct for this bias. We illustrate the decomposition on various algorithms and datasets from the UCI repository.},

A "plug-in rule" for the bandwidth, which is based on the concentration of a reference density, namely, the von Mises distribution is obtained. It is seen that this is equivalent to the usual Euclidean plug-in rule in the case where the concentration becomes large. In case that the concentration parameter is unknown, alternative methods are explored which are intended to be robust to departures from the reference density. Simulations indicate that "wrapped estimators" can perform well in this context. The methods are applied to a real bivariate dataset concerning protein structure. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Maclin2011,
abstract = {An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classi ers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund \& Schapire, 1996; Schapire, 1990) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision trees as our classi cation algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single classi er, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can create ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier - especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the rst few classi ers combined; however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting decision trees.},

abstract = {When performing visualization and classification, people often confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, LLE, and WeightedIso. The results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, WeightedIso, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, BP neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and SVM. The results reveal that S-Isomap excels compared to Isomap and WeightedIso in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods.},

abstract = {Recently the reduced support vector machine (RSVM) was proposed as an alternate of the standard SVM. Motivated by resolving the difficulty on handling large data sets using SVM with nonlinear kernels, it preselects a subset of data as support vectors and solves a smaller optimization problem. However, several issues of its practical use have not been fully discussed yet. For example, we do not know if it possesses comparable generalization ability as the standard SVM. In addition, we would like to see for how large problems RSVM outperforms SVM on training time. In this paper we show that the RSVM formulation is already in a form of linear SVM and discuss four RSVM implementations. Experiments indicate that in general the test accuracy of RSVM are a little lower than that of the standard SVM. In addition, for problems with up to tens of thousands of data, if the percentage of support vectors is not high, existing implementations for SVM is quite competitive on the training time. Thus, from this empirical study, RSVM will be mainly useful for either larger problems or those with many support vectors. Experiments in this paper also serve as comparisons of: 1) different implementations for linear SVM and 2) standard SVM using linear and quadratic cost functions.},

abstract = {A lot of literature has been written about credit risk models, but most focuses on the application of data mining to develop credit scorecards for either acquisition of new costumers or to measure the behavior of existing customers. Besides these models, there are enumerable applications of analytics that can be carried out along the credit cycle. In this keynote we are going to present analytics innovations that have been applied through the different stages of the credit life. For this purpose we have divided the credit cycle in three main parts: pre- origination, origination and post-origination. At all stages we use methodologies such as neural networks, survival analysis, basket market, association rules, CART, CHAID, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm optimization, clustering and more. The pre-origination stage refers to the exploration of potential customers. At this stage, analytics are applied to develop propensity models and to segment the potential costumers in order to split hairs and deliver value offers differentiated by profiles. The origination stage refers to the process of granting a product to a costumer. Beside the well-known origination scorecards there are other tools such as: income models, profitability models, costumer profiling model before developing the origination scorecard, optimization to calculate the credit lines and make multiple offers to the client, etc. Finally, the post- origination stage includes everything that has to do with managing existing customers. Here we use analytics tools like: a profitability index in order to increase or decrease credit limits, attrition models, cross-selling models, fraud models, collection models, recovery models, behavior models by product and by client, among others.},

abstract = {Most classification algorithms are "passive", in that they assign a class label to each instance based only on the description given, even if that description is incomplete. By contrast, an active classifier can - at some cost - obtain the values of some unspecified attributes, before deciding upon a class label. This can be useful, for instance, when deciding whether to gather information relevant to a medical procedure or experiment. The expected utility of using an active classifier depends on both the cost required to obtain the values of additional attributes and the penalty incurred if the classifier outputs the wrong classification. This paper analyzes the problem of learning optimal active classifiers, using a variant of the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) model. After defining the framework, we show that this task can be achieved efficiently when the active classifier is allowed to perform only (at most) a constant number of tests. We then show that, in more general environments, this task of learning optimal active classifiers is often intractable. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {"Steve Baker puts his finger on perhaps the most important cultural trend today: the explosion of data about every aspect of our world and the rise of applied math gurus who know how to use it." --Chris Anderson, Editor-in-Chief of Wired Magazine (Wired Magazine )An urgent look at how a global math elite is predicting and altering our behavior -- at work, at the mall, and in bedEvery day we produce loads of data about ourselves simply by living in the modern world: we click web pages, flip channels, drive through automatic toll booths, shop with credit cards, and make cell phone calls. Now, in one of the greatest undertakings of the twenty-first century, a savvy group of mathematicians and computer scientists is beginning to sift through this data to dissect us and map out our next steps. Their goal? To manipulate our behavior -- what we buy, how we vote -- without our even realizing it.In this tour de force of original reporting and analysis, journalist Stephen Baker provides us with a fascinating guide to the world we're all entering -- and to the people controlling that world. The Numerati have infiltrated every realm of human affairs, profiling us as workers, shoppers, patients, voters, potential terrorists -- and lovers. The implications are vast. Our privacy evaporates. Our bosses can monitor and measure our every move (then reward or punish us). Politicians can find the swing voters among us, by plunking us all into new political groupings with names like "Hearth Keepers" and "Crossing Guards." It can sound scary. But the Numerati can also work on our behalf, diagnosing an illness before we're aware of the symptoms, or even helping us find our soul mate. Surprising, enlightening, and deeply relevant, The Numerati shows how a powerful new endeavor -- the mathematical modeling of humanity -- will transform every aspect of our lives.STEPHEN BAKER has written for BusinessWeek for over twenty years, covering Mexico and Latin America, the Rust Belt, European technology, and a host of other topics, including blogs, math, and nanotechnology. But he's always considered himself a foreign correspondent. This, he says, was especially useful as he met the Numerati. "While I came from the world of words, they inhabited the symbolic realms of math and computer science. This was foreign to me. My reporting became an anthropological mission." Baker has written for many publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, and the Boston Globe. He won an Overseas Press Club Award for his portrait of the rising Mexican auto industry. He is the coauthor of blogspotting.net, featured by the New York Times as one of fifty blogs to watch.},

@article{Tenenbaum2000,
abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

If not, you may be missing out on a potent competitive tool. In Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, Thomas H. Davenport and Jeanne G. Harris argue that the frontier for using data to make decisions has shifted dramatically. Certain high-performing enterprises are now building their competitive strategies around data-driven insights that in turn generate impressive business results. Their secret weapon? Analytics: sophisticated quantitative and statistical analysis and predictive modeling. Exemplars of analytics are using new tools to identify their most profitable customers and offer them the right price, to accelerate product innovation, to optimize supply chains, and to identify the true drivers of financial performance. A wealth of examples--from organizations as diverse as Amazon, Barclay's, Capital One, Harrah's, Procter \& Gamble, Wachovia, and the Boston Red Sox--illuminate how to leverage the power of analytics.},

abstract = {: This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation 's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question.

abstract = {Predictive models are critical for risk adjustment in clinical research. Evaluation of supervised learning models often focuses on predictive model discrimination, sometimes neglecting the assessment of their calibration. Recent research in machine learning has shown the benefits of calibrating predictive models, which becomes especially important when probability estimates are used for clinical decision making. By extending the isotonic regression method for recalibration to obtain a smoother fit in reliability diagrams, we introduce a novel method that combines parametric and non-parametric approaches. The method calibrates probabilistic outputs smoothly and shows better generalization ability than its ancestors in simulated as well as real world biomedical data sets.},

@article{Chawla2002,
abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

But a powerful new business tool--analytics--is enabling many firms to aggressively leverage their data in key business decisions and processes, with impressive results. ... Now, in Analytics at Work, Davenport, Harris and coauthor Robert Morison reveal how all managers can effectively deploy analytics in their day-to-day operations--one business decision at a time. The authors show how many types of analytical tools, from statistical analyis to qualitative measures like systematic behavior coding, can improve decisions about everything from what new product offering might interest customers to whether marketing dollars are being most effectively deployed. Based on new research and illustrated with examples from companies including Humana, Best Buy, Progressive Insurance, and Hotels.com, this implementation-focused guide outlines a five-step model for deploying and succeeding with analytical initiatives. You'll learn how to: use data more effectively to glean valuable analytical insights; manage and coordinate data, people, and technology at an enterprise level; understand and support what analytical leaders do; evaluate and choose realistic targets for analytical activity; recruit, hire, and manage analysis. Combining the science of quantitative analysis with the art of sound reasoning, Analytics at Work provides a road map and tools for unleashing the potential buried in your company's data."--Book jacket.},

It then provides a practical how-to-guide for scorecard development, including data collection, scorecard implementation, and use within the credit risk management cycle. Including numerous real-life examples and an extensive glossary and bibliography, the text assumes little prior knowledge making it an indispensable desktop reference for graduate students in statistics, business, economics and finance, MBA students, credit risk and financial practitioners.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

@article{Tversky1974,
abstract = {This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgements under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

This guide also helps you understand the many data-mining techniques in use today. Based on an MBA course Provost has taught at New York University over the past ten years, Data Science for Business provides examples of real-world business problems to illustrate these principles. You’ll not only learn how to improve communication between business stakeholders and data scientists, but also how participate intelligently in your company’s data science projects. You’ll also discover how to think data-analytically, and fully appreciate how data science methods can support business decision-making. Understand how data science fits in your organization—and how you can use it for competitive advantage Treat data as a business asset that requires careful investment if you’re to gain real value Approach business problems data-analytically, using the data-mining process to gather good data in the most appropriate way Learn general concepts for actually extracting knowledge from data Apply data science principles when interviewing data science job candidates},

Although prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters are adaptive and, given time, will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud and computer intrusion, to name but a few. We describe the tools available for statistical fraud detection and the areas in which fraud detection technologies are most used.},

@article{Lam1997,
abstract = {It has been demonstrated that combining the decisions of several classifiers can lead to better recognition results. The combination can be implemented using a variety of strategies, among which majority vote is by far the simplest, and yet it has been found to be just as effective as more complicated schemes in improving the recognition results. This paper examines the mode of operation of the majority vote method in order to gain a deeper understanding of how and why it works, so that a more solid basis can be provided for its future applications to different data and/or domains. In the course of our research, we have analyzed this method from its foundations and obtained many new and original results regarding its behavior. Particular attention has been directed toward the changes in the correct and error rates when classifiers are added, and conditions are derived under which their addition/elimination would be valid for the specific objectives of the application. At the same time, our theoretical findings are compared against experimental results, and these results do reflect the trends predicted by the theoretical considerations},

@article{Breiman1998,
abstract = {Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of unstable$\backslash$nclassifiers such as trees or neural nets results in reduced test$\backslash$nset error. One of the more effective is bagging. Here, modified training$\backslash$nsets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers$\backslash$nconstructed using these training sets and then combined by voting.$\backslash$nFreund and Schapire propose an algorithm the basis of which is to$\backslash$nadaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym arcing) so that$\backslash$nthe weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most$\backslash$noften misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting.$\backslash$nArcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction.$\backslash$nWe explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and$\backslash$nto bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce$\backslash$nthe definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components$\backslash$nof the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on$\backslash$na large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining$\backslash$nmultiple versions either through bagging or arcing reduces variance$\backslash$nsignificantly.},

@article{DeGroot1983,
abstract = {In this paper we present methods for comparing and evaluating forecasters whose predictions are presented as their subjective probability distributions of various random variables that will be observed in the future, e.g. weather forecasters who each day must specify their own probabilities that it will rain in a particular location. We begin by reviewing the concepts of calibration and refinement, and describing the relationship between this notion of refinement and the notion of sufficiency in the comparison of statistical experiments. We also consider the question of interrelationships among forecasters and discuss methods by which an observer should combine the predictions from two or more different forecasters. Then we turn our attention to the concept of a proper scoring rule for evaluating forecasters, relating it to the concepts of calibration and refinement. Finally, we discuss conditions under which one forecaster can exploit the predictions of another forecaster to obtain a better score.},

@article{Herland2014,
abstract = {The amount of data produced within Health Informatics has grown to be quite vast, and analysis of this Big Data grants potentially limitless possibilities for knowledge to be gained. In addition, this information can improve the quality of healthcare offered to patients. However, there are a number of issues that arise when dealing with these vast quantities of data, especially how to analyze this data in a reliable manner. The basic goal of Health Informatics is to take in real world medical data from all levels of human existence to help advance our understanding of medicine and medical practice. This paper will present recent research using Big Data tools and approaches for the analysis of Health Informatics data gathered at multiple levels, including the molecular, tissue, patient, and population levels. In addition to gathering data at multiple levels, multiple levels of questions are addressed: human-scale biology, clinical-scale, and epidemic-scale. We will also analyze and examine possible future work for each of these areas, as well as how combining data from each level may provide the most promising approach to gain the most knowledge in Health Informatics.},

@book{Tidd2011,
abstract = {Managing Innovation is an established, bestselling text for MBA, MSc and advanced undergraduate courses on management of technology, innovation management and entrepreneurship. It is also used widely by managers in both the service and manufacturing sectors. Now in its fourth edition, Managing Innovation has been fully revised and updated based on extensive user feedback to incorporate the latest findings and techniques in innovation management. The authors have included a new and more explicit innovation model, which is used throughout the book and have introduced two new features - Research Notes and Views from the Front Line - to incorporate more real life case material into the book. The strong evidence-based and practical approach makes this a must-read for anyone studying or working within innovation.An extensive website accompanies this text at www.managing-innovation.com. Readers can browse an online database of audio and video clips, as well as case study material, interactive exercises and tools for innovation, whilst lecturers can find additional support material including instructor slides and teaching guides and tips."Tidd and Bessant's text has become a standard for students and practitioners of innovation. They offer a lively account on innovation management full of interesting and new examples, but one that at the same is rigorously anchored in what we have learned over the last thirty years on how to manage that ultimate business challenge of renewing products, processes, and business models. Those who want to innovate must read this book."—Professor Arnoud De Meyer, Director, Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, UK"Innovation matters and this book by two leaders in the field which is clear and practical as well as rigorous should be essential reading for all seeking to study or to become involved in innovation."—Chris Voss, Professor of Operations and Technology Management, London Business School"...comprehensive and comprehensible compendium on the management of innovation. It is very well organized and very well presented. A pedagogic tool that will work at multiple levels for those wishing to gain deeper insights into some of the most challenging and important management issues of the day."—David J. Teece, Thomas W. Tusher Professor in Global Business, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, USA"Those of us who teach in the field of Innovation Management were delighted when the first edition of this book appeared 11 years ago. The field had long been in need of such a comprehensive and integrated empirically-based work. The fact that this is now the 4th edition is clear testimony to the value of its contribution. We are deeply indebted to the authors for their dedication and diligence in providing us with this updated and expanded volume."—Thomas J. Allen,Howard W.
